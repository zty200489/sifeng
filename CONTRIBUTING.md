# Welcome

Hi, welcome to Sifeng (思风, the trend of thinking in Chinese). We are looking forward to your experience in helping us build this project together. Sifeng is a project that aims to provide a platform for researchers to easily build up quant frameworks and test their ideas. So, we've put together this guideline as to help you figure out where you can be helpful!

# Ground rules & Expecations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

- Be thoughtful for others. We all have different backgrounds and customaries, what seems straightforward for one may be complete gibberish for another, which means we should think about others when coding or writing documents. Be sure to add enough annotations and explinations for everyone to understand.
- Please make sure what you add is not in conflict with others interests (like adding a model whose owner might not want to share, trade secrets, for examlpe.)

# How to contribute

## Contribute

When you have something in mind you would want to share so badly that wasn't in the project,you can first go through the [pull requests](https://github.com/zty200489/sifeng/pulls) and see if anyone else already have the same idea.

If not, you can start by **forking** the project. Next, **clone** it to your local workspace with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/sifeng.git
cd sifeng
```

Then when you are in its directory, **checkout** to your own feature branch from the dev branch to start working on your idea with (replace `feature-name` as appropriate):

```shell
git checkout -b feat/feature-name origin/dev
```

You can now start working, be sure to make **commits** regularly to keep track of each milestone you make, and be please sure to make commit message useful and informative:

```shell
git add .
git commit -a -m "feat: some message here."
```

When you feel like you are done, it's time to **push** your local commits to your remote repo (replace `feature-name` as appropriate):

```shell
git push origin feat/feature-name
```

Then you can notify others of your changes by making a **pull request**, goto pull requests page of your repo and request a merge of your updates into dev branch, along with some message about what you have done. If there are no problem, your contributions will be merged into the dev branch shortly and be released in the next version. Congrats! Now, you are a proud contributor of this project.
